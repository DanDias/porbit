## TODO
* Resize all game elements when game area/window resizes
* Maybe just point asteroid in a random direction on the unit circle with less velocity, to give a better shape to their approach
* Do smarter updates to simulated paths?
* Object pooling...
* Use mass and speed to inflict damage instead of just 1 point every time?
* Planet Durability
* Fail/Win Conditions
* Intercept formula - not sure why but I have to cut it in half to actually hit. Unit conversion problem?
* Find a better way to do object collision events
* Run asteroids through simulation engine to get a predictable path
* Maybe change shield concept to have them provide a full shield to the planet as long as they are in orbit. 1 durability per 2 satellites.
* CLEAN UP!
* ~~Refactor to merge gun functionality~~
* ~~Refactor to merge targetting functionality~~
* ~~Interceptor to do it's normal orbit, when it detects something it'll fly out, attack it and then return to the orbit.~~
